aREST-demo
==========

Demo of the aREST library using WiFi, Bluetooth and XBee modules. The library implements a REST API for Arduino compatible with WiFi & Serial communications. The repository is composed of two folders:

- arduino_code: contains all the different sketches for the Arduino boards 
- interface: code for a simple web application to control a WiFi module, a Bluetooth module and a XBee module using the aREST library.
